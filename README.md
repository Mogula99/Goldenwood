# Game Description
Goldenwood is a singleplayer strategic web game inspired by [Travian](https://www.travian.com), [Ikariam](https://www.ikariam.com), [Divok√© kmeny](https://www.divokekmeny.cz) and other web games where you manage your village, build units and send them to fight other players.

The game is written in C#. It uses ASP.NET to build its API, Entity Framework to communicate with SQLite DB, and .NET MAUI for the client.

## Game Views

In the game, there are three views:

1, **Village surroundings view** - you can see the stats of your village and upgrade the buildings responsible for the production of gold & wood. You can also recruit military units here.

2, **Village view** - you can build buildings that can further improve your income (or reduce the time needed to receive resources) or allow you to recruit new, better units.
